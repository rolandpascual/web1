                    Love tequila drinks? Then you are probably all too familiar with this classic tequila, lime and triple sec cocktail. The Margarita was probably first made in Tijuana bar by an Irish bar owner named Madden and was invented quite by mistake when he grabbed the wrong bottle while mixing up a drink.
