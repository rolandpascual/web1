                    While the origin of Margarita is still clouded in mystery, it still remain as one of the most popular cocktail in North America. There are many stories about who invented the margarita as there are margarita recipes. Some like them sweetened, and others like it blended, but there is no doubt that Classic Margarita is still the best.
